# SGP4

[![CI Status](https://github.com/nsat/sgp4-rs/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nsat/sgp4-rs/actions)

This crate implements a wrapper around the SGP-4 orbital propagator as provided in the "Revisiting
Spacetrack Report #3" paper ([link](https://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/)). It
provides high level bindings to the propagator library with a more modern interface.
